RSS volunteers have provided #COVID19 relief to 16,43,000 people across 32,000 locations in India. In that 3,00,000 are migrant workers.   How many lakh poor have JNU Communists served till now?  How about Rahul Gandhi's various teams?  How about Owaisi's party workers?
These are good questions. We need to focus on #inclusion, not #seclution... Not only for the students that are missing out on things like prom, but those that were never able to attend and no accommodations were made. The few have become the many. #FaceToFaceMatters

Surprise surprise. The #CCP and it's army of #wumao are behind the mass panic over #COVID19 a month ago. The Chinese government can't be trusted with anything -- it's clear that they're trying to play the long game and rise as the world leader once this is all over.
3/ #COVID19 has forced many people to work in new ways and places. It has stopped others from working at all. Emergency cash injections and income guarantees have gone from being impossible to inevitable. But joblessness and lack of cash won't disappear with the virus.
It‚Äôs interesting that since Gove made his asinine ‚Äòlet‚Äôs run this hot‚Äô comments on #COVID19 and what looked like the start of a half-baked leadership campaign on Ridge, he has disappeared completely from sight.

It is interesting to watch/read the press briefings about #Covid19 in UG and KEN whether by the @MOH_Kenya /@MinofHealthUG or by the two presidents. The tone in Kenya is surprisingly militaristic/accusatory and so the public response to the briefings is also more negative.

1/ #COVID19 stream of thoughts/questions. So many mixed messages out there and the media (just doing their job) latching onto anything novel or new. Key questions right now that will guide our "opening up":
As of 22 April, 2020, 21:15, the current situation regarding #COVID19 in Turkey and around the world:  A total of 750,944 tests have been performed. There are currently 98,674 confirmed cases, 2,376 related deaths, and 16,477 discharges in #Turkey. https://t.co/J88UvxlvIu
Today is Wed. That means @realDonaldTrump is lying, again. @CDCDirector already promoted on Twitter an article about his quote that 2nd #COVID19 wave could be worse because it coincides with flu.  It would be another dereliction of duty for Trump to not plan for that possibility.
