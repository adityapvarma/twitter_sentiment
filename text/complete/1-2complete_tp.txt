The UN predicts famine &amp; mass starvation across the world as a result of the economic shutdown. The good news, from the media‚Äôs point of view, is that they can count the famine &amp; starvation deaths as #Coronavirus deaths, thus vindicating the hysteria that caused the cataclysm

I want all  #COVId19 deaths counted but in our 24/7 dashboard world I don‚Äôt want undue panic when new #‚Äôs shoot up - esp. when the COVID death tag is used so broadly.

Serious question for those of you that are in the ‚Äúwe need to expand testing‚Äù camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it‚Äôs safe to assume I‚Äôm not the only one.
Houstonians are doing what we are asking them to do. They are wearing masks, they are #SocialDistancing.   If we open up too soon, we could possibly undo much of the progress we have made.   #COVID19 is a healthcare crisis irrespective of a person‚Äôs political party and ethnicity.
@BreakingLu The 14 day incubation period is going to be the thing. This #COVID19 isnt a death sentence until the hospitals fill up.
They have also said people who have recovered have ‚Äúno evidence of immunity‚Äù. If people who recover have no immunity (which almost certainly must be wrong) how can immunity to unrelated virus help? I think the WHO is run by fools or at least people who think we‚Äôre fools.
We put her on ‚Äúlung bypass‚Äù or ECMO, which is reserved for the sickest #COVID19 patients. Glad she did so well

The UN predicts famine &amp; mass starvation across the world as a result of the economic shutdown. The good news, from the media‚Äôs point of view, is that they can count the famine &amp; starvation deaths as #Coronavirus deaths, thus vindicating the hysteria that caused the cataclysm
The #Covid19 crisis &amp; shutting of businesses in the Middle East have left thousands of Indian workers in deep distress &amp; desperate to return home. The Govt must organise flights to bring home our brothers &amp; sisters most in need of assistance, with quarantine plans in place.

#COVID19 is expected to crest in our region this week. Sadly, it will translate to more people testing positive. And more deaths. Until we have more testing to understand the depth of this virus in our community, we cannot weaken rules like our stay at home order in @SaintLouCo.
@GOPLeader You are such a propagandizing liar! @SpeakerPelosi saved lives and ensured a better bill was passed by getting $25B for testing. took a week to get the filthy @GOP to allow funding for #coronavirus #testing.    Makes Pelosi a life saving hero. You're still the asshole.

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?
