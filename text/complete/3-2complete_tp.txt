we have it so backwards in portland...  Our leaders are handing trust to ppl driving multi-ton vehicles on relatively empty streets (who are speeding and doing crazy stuff!) -- while distrusting people who want &amp; need to walk &amp; bike safely on those same streets.
@GoHealio Unfortunately, incorrect information is circulating. #ContactLens wear is safe during the pandemic, according to new research available at https://t.co/a5pGSZJ3Xf. Proper #HandWashing is highly crucial during #COVID19, as is regular washing of spectacles with water and soap. https://t.co/R6mqHiLV7x

My #COVID19 test is ‚Äúnegative‚Äù but the doctor says if you still have the symptoms, which I do, presume you are infected. Which sounds crazy but whatever.  So the doctors gave me a note to stay in quarantine until I‚Äôm symptom free 72 hours. So good news and bad news.

The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?
I think we mostly took matters into our own hands. Schools, Shops &amp; Business closed against Government advice. Unfortunately elderly in care homes bore the brunt. Staff pleaded for PPE and told not needed. If and when this is over all this should be investigated.
