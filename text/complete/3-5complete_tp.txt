It's the Persian Gulf not the American Gulf. The Trump regime badly miscalculated if it thinks Iran will be intimidated. Trump has not yet paid for the murder of General Soleimani or Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Hence, it would be best if he focused on the #COVID19 catastrophe at home.

I figured out an awesome #coronavirus strategy to keep normal people safe and Republicans #covidiots happy: - Everyone should stay home until end of June except Republicans - Republicans are free to #covfefe with Republicans anytime, but must hold rallies at least once a week
In our efforts to provide maximum protection against #covid19 and to provide appropriate healthcare, our hope is that it reach Maldivians, Bangladeshis or any other foreign national equally, with no discrimination. We are in this together and we will come out of together!
Key signif of new autopsy info: - pushes back the date for 1st US #COVID19 death by a full month - shows virus was in Calif in early Feb, maybe late Jan - shows there was already community spread - #Trump China travel ban started Feb 2 -- virus already in 2 states, at least.

1/ Because so many have re-sent this to me, here's my take.   This was a garbage "study" and we learn nothing from it. 1- not randomized.  MD's selected patients based on severity 2 - HCQ *late* in disease vs early when antivirals provide most benefit 3 - No zinc
Antibody tests should be used with appropriate caution, and not for healthcare decision making for individual patients. They're a useful tool for population level screening to inform public health decisions, but we need to know  their specificity to be reliable for those purposes https://t.co/vu78mTJlWi
