The UN predicts famine &amp; mass starvation across the world as a result of the economic shutdown. The good news, from the media‚Äôs point of view, is that they can count the famine &amp; starvation deaths as #Coronavirus deaths, thus vindicating the hysteria that caused the cataclysm
Samples of those early cases were sent to the CDC and results came back today that they were indeed the first US cases (that we know of)  And it again raises the question of whether or not there are many more at-home #COVID19 deaths not part of the death toll tabulation

1/ Because so many have re-sent this to me, here's my take.   This was a garbage "study" and we learn nothing from it. 1- not randomized.  MD's selected patients based on severity 2 - HCQ *late* in disease vs early when antivirals provide most benefit 3 - No zinc

Serious question for those of you that are in the ‚Äúwe need to expand testing‚Äù camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it‚Äôs safe to assume I‚Äôm not the only one.

If one is tested, tested neg, then gets sic a week later. How do you stop it?? Don't believe that a true immunization will work, e.g. yearly flu. Wife got this year's immunization - got sick. I didn't - got sick. She an I lasted the same amount of time. So no guarantees.

The UK has now over a third #COVID19 deaths of the US‚Äôs (15,464 versus 39,015) with under a fifth of the size of population. So no, UK unlikely to be no 2 in the world taking into account population size. It‚Äôs a strong contender for the first position in mortality. Devastating.

The UN predicts famine &amp; mass starvation across the world as a result of the economic shutdown. The good news, from the media‚Äôs point of view, is that they can count the famine &amp; starvation deaths as #Coronavirus deaths, thus vindicating the hysteria that caused the cataclysm
People like that need a scape goat.

#COVID19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets. This can happen by  1. Being in close contact with an infected person  2. Touching a contaminated surface  When we congregate in crowds, it puts us all at risk for contracting #COVID19  #StayAtHome #TakeResponsibility https://t.co/RISPgS7a2R
It is critical that we continue to produce more #COVID19 tests and ensure they are made widely available as soon as possible. I'm glad to hear that FDA has just approved the first at-home test, which holds promise to help us overcome this pandemic. #FlaPol #FL07
.@NYGovCuomo is holding NYers hostage, choking our businesses to death unless @realDonaldTrump hands over cash. Remember, he was more than $6B in the hole BEFORE #COVID19 because he &amp; @NYCMayor are spending more than any NY administration ever AND taxing more, delivering LESS.

President Trump says he will sign an order banning green cards for 60 days due to #COVID19. The order can be extended (which he already says he is considering).  The ACLU says he's "more interested in fanning anti-immigrant flames than in saving lives." https://t.co/tbVnY3llbf
@LiaquatShahwani It proves poor governance by Jam gov. Despite concerns, the Gov. of BLN has failed to implement an effective lockdown when it has at its disposal more than 30,000 FC Personals and huge police force. @jam_kamal lacks the vision to use the resources at his disposal. #COVID19
When "war" is used as a metaphor in the fight against #COVID19, the militarization of healthcare is sure to follow - much like the militarization of police during the "war on drugs" and "war on terrorism."   Opposing ANY claims from The Science(TM) makes you an enemy combatant.
