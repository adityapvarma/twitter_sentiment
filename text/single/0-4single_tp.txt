In order to beat #COVID-19 and ease restrictions, testing is paramount. Provinces and territories need more testing kits. When will the Trudeau Liberals fast-track the approval process and clear the backlog?

The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?
Sharing experiences from fight against #coronavirus is crucial for developing better planning against possible second wave of the epidemic. Welcome in üá∏üáÆ, dear üáµüá± friends. @MorawieckiM https://t.co/pav9A12yD9
Serious question for those of you that are in the ‚Äúwe need to expand testing‚Äù camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it‚Äôs safe to assume I‚Äôm not the only one.

A grim thought: the ~2-3% mortality rate of #COVID19 is the worst one could have. Had it been &gt;10% (like SARS, MERS, Ebola) everybody would be shiting on their pants, and take the disease seriously for the begining. Fewer people would have died.

You've no doubt seen talk about "reopening" the country. In Georgia, it's even happening. Is this a good idea? We say that we need more testing in order to know. We definitely need more testing, but even that has limitations in preventing the spread of #COVID19. Why?  A thread.

Two ways of looking at this:  1. We have a pandemic that‚Äôs piling pressure on the NHS &amp; to be indulging in this is in shockingly poor taste. 2. You haven‚Äôt got enough to do despite the Country being under Lockdown (for your benefit) so this is in shockingly poor taste.   Grow up.

How will #AI, #ML, #IOT shape the #banking industry post #COVID19 ? Can #banks learn a lesson from the techniques &amp; #technology used to combat COVID 19?  Article by @SharadBishnoi05   https://t.co/UDTSRWo3PQ  #bankingtechnology #covid19 #digitaltechnology https://t.co/hgRYFRl82s
As I write this, more than 45,100 Americans have succumbed to the #coronavirus. #China killed them. Why are we still doing business with that country?
Resist this tyranny wherever you see it. Use cash whenever possible and boycott retailers who won‚Äôt accept it. Like 5G and mandatory chips/vax, the cashless society is just another wing of the #NWO agenda to monitor and track your every move. #LockdownIreland #Covid19 https://t.co/aC7mK2MqMm
Idiot @GovRonDeSantis look at these numbers and you think we are doing well, you are a clueless and worthless governor who only cares about money not people‚Äôs lives as you hide in your governors mansion.

1/ Okay, this is a big deal. Given the time lag from infection to symptoms to death, it implies that #SARSCoV2 was present in California by mid-January at the latest - but it is very unlikely that the first person to develop #COVID in the US died from it.  https://t.co/Cpgy1pFdO1
