Lots of companies making contact ‘I have 200 masks,’ but when you dig deeper, they don’t have any, they are just offering to act as agents and find some, for a commission.  200 doesn’t even touch the sides. They come in boxes of 6000 #Covid19   https://t.co/1XPgllLqpn
Trump doesn’t rely on a plan to beat Covid-19, he relies on a klan. He doesn’t care if America survives, he cares if he survives.

Too many think that #COVID19 disruption is just something we have to temporarily get through &amp; then things will go back to "normal."  But we MUST &amp; CAN use COVID recovery to make things better than the status quo, which is killing life on Earth. Related readings in comments.👇
Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs—including #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.

Two months ago there were few deaths from the virus. Today there’s over 40,000. There’s not enough tests to even determine who is infected. Reopening society too quickly will cause the 9 deaths in SD to potentially rise higher. Push for adequate testing and contact tracing first!

Was interesting to see in the #coronavirus statement in the Commons how the English Health minister seemed unaware of devolution - surely Scot Gov can remind him :)
The government originally expected 20,000 deaths from #COVID19  Over 18,000 so far and that’s not including deaths outside of Hospitals.   50,000 a more realistic number of overall deaths when this is all over?
#BREAKING Spain says another 435 people died from #coronavirus in the past 24 hours, with the figures showing a slight increase for a second day running, bringing the overall death toll to 21,717 https://t.co/VXn1p1armZ

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

@capt_amarinder I urge you to raise stipend paid to Medical Interns from Rs 9K a month to Rs 23.5K (central governmental standard), while combatting this COVID19 crisis. Raising their stipend will be a positive step in aiding those who are on frontlines fighting against #COVID19.
Today, we ask our national legislators to please not forget these businesses as you consider future economic relief packages in response to this situation. #flattenthecurve #ncbeer #BetterTogether #dayofaction

This is important. Until now the first US #COVID19 death was thought to be Feb 29th, Seattle WA https://t.co/ziFslDHShl But now autopsy (and @CDCgov) confirmation of 2 deaths in California Feb 6 and 17th.  &gt;3 weeks earlier than previously known.

Given the typical 3-4 week lag between exposure and death, they were likely exposed by mid-January.   Important Q for case investigation - had either traveled to China? If not, it would be a sign that community spread was underway even earlier than known.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

The #Covid19 "recovered" stat is meaningless until we know for sure people are actually "recovered" since there are cases where someone has been deemed "recovered" but was not. We need time to qualify such things. Whereas we don't need extra time to determine if someone died.

A few are quickly dismissing serology studies but they're ALL trending in the same direction: 2% to 4% of the population may have already have faced down #COVID19.

Now Matt Hancock says all care sector staff receive the living wage. No they don’t.  In England they receive the “National Living Wage” which is actually only the minimum wage of £8.72 (less for the under 25s) and not the actual living wage of £9.30/hour.  #COVID19

This is good for Toronto. Collecting data on race and income is critical to understanding the disparities in how COVID-19 is impacting communities, in the city’s response, and to ensuring our city’s recovery plans build a much more equitable city. Ontario needs to do the same.

I just read a story that autopsies show CA had its first cases in early Feb, about a month before first the reported case. #NeverForget that the #SpanishFlu originated in Kansas. If patient zero for #COVID19 ends up being an Alabaman on an American-owned cruise ship, #IToldYouSo.

Helen Whately is the care minister. She's had a week to get a grip on the death figures in care homes. She still doesn't know. I'd go as far as to say, she doesn't want to know. When this figure officially comes out it will be shocking.  #GMB @piersmorgan #Covid_19

🚨BREAKING: autopsy results show 2 people in #CA—with NO travel history—died from #coronavirus on Feb 6 and 17, weeks earlier than the previously known 1st #COVID19 death.  Meaning: the virus has been spreading in the US since at least mid-JANUARY.😳  https://t.co/yFguirQx5D

For anyone who still thinks the flu kills more people than COVID19... last year 34,200 people died from the flu. Today, 4 months into the year,8 more months to go... 45,318 people have died from COVID19. #factsMatter #stayHome

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs—including #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.

Just talked to mayor of Albany, GA. He says his city is "absolutely not" ready to reopen.  "We had 15 funerals this weekend. 5 more deaths. We have 60 people on a ventilator at our hospital"  That area has the highest number of #COVID19 deaths in the state.

💚 Happy 50th Birthday Earth Day 💚  While #coronavirus may force us to keep our distance, tackling #ClimateChange must remain a top priority.  No matter where you are, you can make a difference.  Together, we can protect the Earth. 🤝🌍  @EarthDayNetwork | #COP26 | #EarthDay https://t.co/jcLmtKchT5

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

What we know is that #Texas has not done enough testing. In order to know how evasive and where #COVID19 is, we need more testing.   Over the last couple of days, we have maxed out on the tests we have given. We need to distribute more testing in communities that are underserved.

#COVID19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets. This can happen by  1. Being in close contact with an infected person  2. Touching a contaminated surface  When we congregate in crowds, it puts us all at risk for contracting #COVID19  #StayAtHome #TakeResponsibility https://t.co/RISPgS7a2R

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

More Americans have died of #Covid_19 in the past 7 days than died in the entire H1N1 pandemic. Also, none of the crisis websites Trump said would work flawlessly are working.
Great to have this help, but important to differentiate the collecting of samples (which is going on here), and the actual process of testing, which is performed by scientists in laboratories.   Collection is an important role, but very different to testing @IBMScience
⚠️Up to 60% of people infected with #coronavirus are ASYMPTOMATIC, but can still spread this deadly virus.   If we want to reopen safely, we likely need to conduct at least 2-3 million #COVID19 tests per day, so that we can test for both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections.
