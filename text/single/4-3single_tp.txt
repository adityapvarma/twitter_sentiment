covid19 infection	noticing coronavirus lead	others higher	others higher rates	patients dialysis	

The head of the #USSTheodoreRoosevelt's large medical department reportedly backed Capt. #BrettCrozier's call to get his sailors off the #COVID19 infected ship. To me, that goes a long way to bolstering Crozier's postering. On health matters, a ship's doctor has clout.
The Asymptomatic #COVID19 Infection Rate. @danieloran, my colleague @ScrippsRTI, compiled all of the available data, links, text and details from 8 cohorts:  https://t.co/hOzGvZgjxk We believe the rate is ~40% (from top 3); the others w/ higher rates are difficult to interpret. https://t.co/am0XJ9Y1Fb
Doctors are noticing that (1) #coronavirus can lead to #kidney damage (there are a few theories why) and (2) Patients on #dialysis and transplant recipients have compromised immune systems, and are at greater risk of #COVID19 infection. @erikaedwardsnbc   https://t.co/5UHl6Ir30W
I‚Äôm not even looking at the map. Since stupid #Governors are reopening their #States it does not take a genius to figure out that these states will have more #COVID19 infections in a few weeks, which will translate to more deaths.They should be held liable PERIOD ‚ÄºÔ∏è
