Sad reminder that the war waged by #Russia on #Ukraine still kills. Not the end of illegal occupation of #Donbass and #Crimea. #Covid19 pandemic hasn't changed the world. Russian wars are going on now. We are committed after lockdown to stand up to the Kremlin. Let's not forget.
The UN predicts famine &amp; mass starvation across the world as a result of the economic shutdown. The good news, from the media‚Äôs point of view, is that they can count the famine &amp; starvation deaths as #Coronavirus deaths, thus vindicating the hysteria that caused the cataclysm

Genuinely tragic. Corbyn isn't going to let go. But this rambling question, following Starmer's forensic dismantling of Raab, shows exactly why Labour is so much better off without him. And Corbyn will not have the self-awareness to realise this. So he'll be back again and again.

@taradublinrocks @joncoopertweets Isn't that how @sarahkendzior came to the conclusion about Trump having decades-long fantasies about causing mass death, like what's being experienced now with the #coronavirus?

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.
