REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.
@ResisterSis20 Wow. 90% of #COVID19 would have been preventable‚Ä¶ If only he acted a mere two weeks earlier.

Serious question for those of you that are in the ‚Äúwe need to expand testing‚Äù camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it‚Äôs safe to assume I‚Äôm not the only one.

I just do not understand why a country such as the UK with such impeccable healthcare has such a high spread of coronavirus but a third world country like India with abysmal health/hygiene conditions somehow doesn‚Äôt see deaths above 500, that can‚Äôt be explained #COVID19

CRUCIAL email from #Trump @WhiteHouse : they knew on Feb17 that a  #COVID19 crisis loomed, and controlling it would require non-pharmaceutic interventions (NPIs), such as lockdowns and social distancing. #Trump was aware, before Feb 17. Strengthens this https://t.co/vYNWAoHuJO
