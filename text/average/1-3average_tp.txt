"A minimum policy for effective suppression   is population-wide social distancing + with home isolation for cases + school/uni closure.   these policies will need to be maintained until large stocks of vaccine are available to immunise population, which be &gt;18 months" #COVID19

It's the Persian Gulf not the American Gulf. The Trump regime badly miscalculated if it thinks Iran will be intimidated. Trump has not yet paid for the murder of General Soleimani or Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Hence, it would be best if he focused on the #COVID19 catastrophe at home.
Couldn‚Äòt agree more. Some of this feels eerily familiar from my time reporting on #Ebola. If there is one thing that really depresses me about the fight against #covid19 it is how unable we seem to be to learn: from the past, from other places, from each other!

In the middle of the #COVID19 pandemic, Trump continues to find ways to attack us to rile up his base and distract from his failures in his position. Immigrants are at the frontlines of the response making sure there‚Äôs food on the table, working, and putting their lives at risk.

The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?
How is it possible to have three such wildly different estimates of the #COVID19 death toll? Which one is "right"? Short answer is: in a sense all of them. Why? Because there are (v broadly speaking) three ways of measuring deaths from the pandemic:

Fake News on China developing a #COVID19 vaccine from Pakistan media. üëá This is a Clinical Trial that China Sinopharm International Corp. wants to do in Pakistan which will take many months. Basically China will use Pakistanis as Guinea pigs for it with help of Pakistan Army.
This is important. Until now the first US #COVID19 death was thought to be Feb 29th, Seattle WA https://t.co/ziFslDHShl But now autopsy (and @CDCgov) confirmation of 2 deaths in California Feb 6 and 17th.  &gt;3 weeks earlier than previously known.

#Trump "failed to prepare"? As Dr. Deborah Birx, the White House #coronavirus coordinator, said, she looked at the statistics from #China and thought #COVID19 was no more contagious than SARS. Therefore, she did not recommend certain precautions. So who's at fault, @JohnRoss43?
