What to make of that?  Quieter, pared back format really played to Starmer’s strengths. Allowed him to be forensic and measured, no need to play to the gallery. Put Raab under some pressure.   Arithmetic in Parliament is now easy for the govt. The dispatch box will be harder.

This is the first extensive testing that's been done at a Toronto shelter.  It's a shame it took place a full week after the outbreak was first reported, but this needs to continue.  Hoping the results aren't as dire as outbreaks reported at shelters in Boston and San Francisco.
It's absurd to think everyone would be req'd to get tested for the Covid-19. You could get tested one day &amp; the next day unknowingly come into contact w/ someone who has it. A WASTE OF TIME!   You bet there'll be Governer's who will keep the shutdown going for this very reason.😡

You've no doubt seen talk about "reopening" the country. In Georgia, it's even happening. Is this a good idea? We say that we need more testing in order to know. We definitely need more testing, but even that has limitations in preventing the spread of #COVID19. Why?  A thread.

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

To fight #COVID-19 we need to work together to protect health systems, fund vaccines and save lives. @emmanuelmacron @elysee please release €€€ from 🇫🇷 to @WHO @gavi and @CEPIvaccines to help beat this pandemic as soon as possible.
We really dont need any loan from IMF &amp; World Bank to respond to #Covid19. We have enough financial resources; gov. just need to develop balls when it comes to the financial sector &amp; Reserve Bank. Why can’t you impose restrictions on finance capital? Other countries do it well!
LONG THREAD  1) The @WHO &amp; its Director-General @DrTedros are under criticism for aiding China in keeping a lid on the #coronavirus outbreak &amp; not sharing vital, life-saving info with the world.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

BREAKING: UK #coronavirus hospital deaths rise by 763 in past 24hrs, bringing total to  18,100.  * this does not include 1000s more old &amp; vulnerable people who've died with COVID-19 in care homes or community, because Govt can't be bothered to find out exactly how many that is.
I’ve just seen a Financial Times analysis claiming the government are vastly under reporting #COVID19 deaths.   They are claiming the true number could stand at around 41,000.

As @erinallday reports, typically takes a month for someone to die from #COVID19 after infection; suggesting it’s likely person who died Feb. 6 was infected in early January.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.
Now you have a point here. Criminals/ rapists/ burglar as are being let go to continue to commit crimes but a mother is arrested for allowing her children to ride on the swing. 🙄 If she wants to risk her life and the children, let her be.

@EastBayRaetz @JonahDispatch True.  Also true that number of deaths could be inflated.  For instance lots of older, die while infected with flu who are not coded as dying FROM the flu (about 14% one study learned). Not so with #Coronavirus.  With #COVID19 we are reaching for deaths and counting the 'missing'

How do rates of commercialisation for #COVID19 diagnostic tests differ around the world?  New @CamSociology research led by @SJHogarth: https://t.co/tSd1POXuW8  #coronavirus
Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.
@realDonaldTrump The Persian Gulf isn’t your bathtub.  Warships aren’t your playthings you attempt to eat when you grow tired of attacking the bar of soap.  We have nearly 50,000 dead Americans from #COVID19 What do you intend to do about that?  You’re going to prison, traitor.

Prisons and jails are *notorious* for being incredibly deficient when it comes to transparency, even before #COVID19. Is there any expectation that they will inform the public of the truest extent of the spread of the virus within their walls? This is a rhetorical question.

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.
A person who died in Santa Clara County on Feb. 6 was infected with the #coronavirus, a stunning discovery that makes that individual the first recorded COVID-19 fatality in the U.S., according to autopsy results. @ErinAllday and @MatthewKawahara story. https://t.co/MI47X8Fmh8

The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?
National Records of Scotland show reporting confirmed hospital deaths is around 75% lower than total #COVID19 deaths. If the rest of the UK has the same gap between hospital and community deaths, the real death count could be close to 30,000.

#COVID19 has two really big comorbidities: hypertension &amp; diabetes.   If the powers that be want to harm us, doesn’t it seem that the straightest line to that end would be just to leave us untested &amp; untreated? No need to *DO* anything.
As @johnbirdswords says: "Streets kill, maim and harm: living on one is a human rights abuse."  #COVID19 has shown how important #housing is to us as individuals and as a society. There must be a plan - and action - for everyone to have a decent home.🏠 https://t.co/QXMEBR2EW8
