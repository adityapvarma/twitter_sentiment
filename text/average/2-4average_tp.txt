Serious question for those of you that are in the ‚Äúwe need to expand testing‚Äù camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it‚Äôs safe to assume I‚Äôm not the only one.
Where‚Äôs the proof the numbers are padded? New York boosted its #Coronavirus death count by 30%, adding almost 4,000 people who never tested positive. This bogus counting is going on nationwide with CDC encouragement, rendering the entire count unreliable https://t.co/dyqhoSgQ1D

Premature re-opening leads to new deaths. People are dying every 32 seconds in America from #coronavirus. Trump is not talking about reality. If you are harboring the darkest of fantasies these days, I believe that‚Äôs a healthy response. The daily tv show is so wrong, so painful.

The issue here is that the MOH might not allow private hospitals to deal with #COVID19. An alternative could be to involve them indirectly by directing non-corona related patients /cases to private clinics/hospitals paid for/subsidized by MOH; more MOH resources to fight covid19.
