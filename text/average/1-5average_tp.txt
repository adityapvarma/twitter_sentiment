Genuine question - If one aim of the #covid19 lockdown is to protect the elderly and sick, why is the NHS  issuing enforced DNRs on so many of them?   Why are they being denied routine treatments?   What is the rationale here?

Many countries including USA U.K. Germany and most probably now China also have developed #COVID19 vaccine, but it doesn‚Äôt mean that it‚Äôll be availabl anytime soon.Any developed vaccine has to undergo intensive testing before it touches the racks of pharmacies. #92NewsHDPlus

@realDonaldTrump @RepDanCrenshaw No amount of propaganda changes the fact that your ineptitude, arrogance, and incompetence caused the deadly delay in formulating a response to #COVID19 and cost 35,000 Americans their lives.

@LehmannsTerms_ @CorpFred Well, yes. But in other countries they won't count as Covid-19 fatalities, because when they die they don't have the virus, due to the lockdown curtailing infection. But the lockdown hasn't curtailed their dying, because they're dead. This is why the #COVID19 stats are so flawed.

@IngrahamAngle does that mean that the deceased caught COVID19  2 to 3 weeks earlier ? late to mid of Jan #COVID19 in CA. that should make MSM news
@arabbitorduck I give two shits about the testing. Why are we acknowledging death to #Covid19 without performing the tests? When someone dies, it must get reported and recorded. This testing argument so many are trying to make will only reinforce a lower DEATH rate.

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.
I‚Äôm worried a lot about Brazil and Russia epidemics, and also Turkey. Other counties seem to be improving but also hard to say for sure without adequate early testing everywhere. #COVID19 https://t.co/WLcqSHgUXO
