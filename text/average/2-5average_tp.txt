Hi my twitter friends, I am being asked about surveys that explore how #autistic people are doing during these times of #Covid19 - if you know of any current research studies you can DM me or comment below. Thank you. #Autism
This is so wrong üò°  Cuomo ordered nursing homes to ADMIT patients who tested positive for #COVID19, saying ‚ÄúNecessary precautions will be taken to protect other residents there‚Äù  But release the prisoners - they may be at risk?!  https://t.co/h6xWFIcJ7G
And this graph, again from National Records of Scotland (NRS), shows the difference between their figures and those from Health Protection Scotland (HPS), who count deaths in hospitals where #COVID19 has been tested. Therefore NRS more accurate figure. #coronavirus https://t.co/q2tPwVfk1B
How many people who are sick with non-COVID illnesses are going to die because they didn't‚Äîor couldn't‚Äîseek care over the last month? I'm not aware of any epidemiologists modeling that. https://t.co/o0kmmL48w1 #COVID19

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

Donald Trump and Imran Khan had a phone call today-their first, I believe, in 2020. No surprises about the topics, based on this readout. Though I'm struck that PM Khan didn't bring up Kashmir at all (unless he did and it's not highlighted here, which would also be surprising).

It has now been several months since #COVID19 first entered our consciousness. We still have much to learn about it. But, to my thinking, three key points have become clear. I will try to summarize them here.
And it's critical to underscore: @SecWilkie is obscuring the overall #COVID19 veteran deaths nationally by reporting ONLY deaths taking place at @DeptVetAffairs facilities. Most vets are dying at their nearest civilian hospitals. They are mixed into morgues with everyone else.
"The other factor ... for any #age group is whether a person is following CDC and state #guidelines. Things like not practicing #socialdistancing, skimping on good #handwashing and not wearing a #mask can all increase personal #risk, no matter how young or old you are."

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

I think adopting remote work will show that number of employees are not needed. Also, number of tasks can be outsourced. #corona has enforced the world of businesses sharply.
Genuine question - If one aim of the #covid19 lockdown is to protect the elderly and sick, why is the NHS  issuing enforced DNRs on so many of them?   Why are they being denied routine treatments?   What is the rationale here?
