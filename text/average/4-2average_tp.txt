THIS is why ‚Å¶@realDonaldTrump‚Å© &amp; @GOP‚Å© pushed back when ‚Å¶@SenFeinstein‚Å© &amp; Democrats wanted to send Iran $5 billion for #COVID19. As the Iranian people are dying from the virus, hunger, &amp; poverty, Iran spends all it‚Äôs $ on the IRGC &amp; proxies. https://t.co/Ud4JPttzn2

The virus had obviously circulating for many weeks if not longer  out West...and soon we will see just how the viral stains attenuated. Fascinating.  We made big decisions based on faulty data, bad models.
Antibody tests should be used with appropriate caution, and not for healthcare decision making for individual patients. They're a useful tool for population level screening to inform public health decisions, but we need to know  their specificity to be reliable for those purposes

COVID cases will drop this summer. It may not be b/c of seasonal drop or warm weather. #COVID19 has spread in warm climates like Singapore &amp; Iran. But in most of US, epidemic curve will have peaked by summer. But we should expect a 2nd &amp; 3rd wave in Fall &amp; Winter.  #AskReuters
We propose ‚Ç¨3 billion macro-financial assistance to support ten neighbouring countries as a futile gesture now that the #coronavirus pandemic is easing.  Not sure where we'll get the money from, but hopefully the UK will stump up their ¬£39 billion soon. Otherwise we'll print it.
Social distancing doesn‚Äôt have to mean social isolation. Checking in with friends and family can help you feel more connected and supported during this time. More tips on coping with stress and anxiety here: https://t.co/vCcOacRtAt #COVID19 https://t.co/9RTBT6WBZI
@Reuters @Reuters I think it is hard to know what will happen over the summer. As we have seen in warm weather climates #COVID19 has been able to spread so I think we need to continue to be just as vigilant over the summer with identifying, isolating, and contact tracing people
