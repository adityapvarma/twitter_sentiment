The #COVID19 virus hasn’t “peaked”, it’s been slowed down and is approaching a level of containment. “Peaking” suggests it’s run its course and won’t get any worse. The semantics are important.

It's the Persian Gulf not the American Gulf. The Trump regime badly miscalculated if it thinks Iran will be intimidated. Trump has not yet paid for the murder of General Soleimani or Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Hence, it would be best if he focused on the #COVID19 catastrophe at home.

Lots of companies making contact ‘I have 200 masks,’ but when you dig deeper, they don’t have any, they are just offering to act as agents and find some, for a commission.  200 doesn’t even touch the sides. They come in boxes of 6000 #Covid19   https://t.co/1XPgllLqpn

I’m extremely frustrated that nobody seems to pay attention to using (combination of) mild symptoms as a smart way to identify potential #COVID19 infection in the scarcity of testing. The advice on self-isolation is so crude &amp; no one following contacts of symptomatic people 🤯🤯
I’m tired of this government acting like the virus starts roaming the streets at 7:01pm. Stop putting people found offending the curfew in forced quarantine and start developing meaningful solutions instead.

Key signif of new autopsy info: - pushes back the date for 1st US #COVID19 death by a full month - shows virus was in Calif in early Feb, maybe late Jan - shows there was already community spread - #Trump China travel ban started Feb 2 -- virus already in 2 states, at least.

The opening of businesses is a way to get people off of unemployment by making people choose if they will work despite health risks. Because if you choose not to work you are disqualified from unemployment. THATS why GA is opening up clearly unsafe businesses. #wagthedog #COVID19
Those holding #COVID19 solely responsible for NH's success are neglecting the growth of its IP.  The lockdown has likely given it a boost, but it'd be happening regardless. It's a gigantuan system-seller franchise that will be treated as vitally as Mario/Zelda going forward.

IL &amp; most other states are fighting #COVID19 &amp; helping the sick every day. The costs to our state &amp; localities are enormous at a time when they’re losing revenues because the economy is closed. The next aid bill MUST help state &amp; local governments fund this revenue shortfall.
The Trump Administration has made a commitment to include this funding for state &amp; local governments in the next #COVID19 relief package. I look forward to making sure they follow through on that promise – we cannot afford to leave our state &amp; local governments out to dry.

Not only is this dangerous -- but it's self-defeating.   Trump's "no one saw it coming" defense to #coronavirus is absurd .... but a "no one saw it coming" defense to the second wave will not pass the laugh test with anyone.
When the new #Coronavirus originated in Wuhan, the Chinese Communist Party covered up its severity and let it get out of control. This ignorance has thrown the world into chaos. We must hold the CCP accountable for the harm its caused the Chinese people and the global economy.
Given the shortage of N95 respirators during this global outbreak of #COVID19, it’s important to understand the difference between N95 respirators and surgical masks, and how both are intended to protect healthcare workers. Learn more from @NIOSH: https://t.co/rGGoSYmo30. https://t.co/HJNQfoAWk9

Let’s be clear: Matt Hancock's target was not to increase "capacity" to 100,000 #COVID19  tests a day, it was to actually do those tests. https://t.co/iKfjTptd2c
Antibody tests should be used with appropriate caution, and not for healthcare decision making for individual patients. They're a useful tool for population level screening to inform public health decisions, but we need to know  their specificity to be reliable for those purposes https://t.co/vu78mTJlWi

BREAKING: UK #coronavirus hospital deaths rise by 763 in past 24hrs, bringing total to  18,100.  * this does not include 1000s more old &amp; vulnerable people who've died with COVID-19 in care homes or community, because Govt can't be bothered to find out exactly how many that is.
This is taking responsibility. President Trump @realDonaldTrump has yet to say , "blame me". If you are in charge then you must take the blame and the credit. Not play videos at a briefing trying to prove how much you have done or how good you are. #COVID19 #CoronaVirusTRUTH

@SusanDelacourt Before the actual lockdown I had symptoms, a slight fever, chills, headache at the back of my head and terrible joint pain,  absolutely no cough or cold ..so yes I have wondered.
@Evra thank you 🙏. You’re time was very much appreciated.

1/ Because so many have re-sent this to me, here's my take.   This was a garbage "study" and we learn nothing from it. 1- not randomized.  MD's selected patients based on severity 2 - HCQ *late* in disease vs early when antivirals provide most benefit 3 - No zinc

Just for comparison, New Zealand - the entire country - has 1,451 confirmed &amp; 14 deaths.   Snohomish County has 822,083 people living in it. New Zealand has just under 5 million.   That's why we don't let moronic sheriffs adjudicate legal, never mind medical, practices.

Key takeaway from a big #COVID19 action plan report: 📌Expand aggressive testing 📌Create a health corps for contact tracing📌Create a data platform
Antibody tests should be used with appropriate caution, and not for healthcare decision making for individual patients. They're a useful tool for population level screening to inform public health decisions, but we need to know  their specificity to be reliable for those purposes
