@capt_amarinder I urge you to raise stipend paid to Medical Interns from Rs 9K a month to Rs 23.5K (central governmental standard), while combatting this COVID19 crisis. Raising their stipend will be a positive step in aiding those who are on frontlines fighting against #COVID19.

Serious question for those of you that are in the ‚Äúwe need to expand testing‚Äù camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it‚Äôs safe to assume I‚Äôm not the only one.
The Coronavirus pandemic has revealed a gaping wound in our healthcare system. Defeating #COVID19 will require individual sacrifice. Healing our  communities will require addressing longstanding inequities which, if not addressed now will become more significant  in the future.

BREAKING: PM announces help for students, long felt left out of other #COVID19 financial aid. New Canada Emergency Student Benefit provides $1,250/month May-August, or $1,750 if a student takes care of someone else or has a disability. This compares to $2,000/month from CERB.
In #Covid19 crisis students should be able to end rent contracts early with no penalty. Many on low incomes or lost part-time jobs. Hardship and poverty are a reality for too many young people. Rent refund will make significant difference @OCallaghanCian   https://t.co/jl3eBcMyzX

Thank you, @SecWilkie. The media is desperate to attack #Hydroxycloroquine because they hate @realDonaldTrump.  Lives will be lost unnecessarily because of this unhinged coverage of this effective treatment and likely preventative. #coronavirus https://t.co/Oml1MnoUaX
A while back the President was promoting unproven drug therapies to help #Covid19 patients (even implying medical professionals take it as a preventive.) You don‚Äôt hear him saying that as much any more. Good reminder to not believe everything someone says. https://t.co/3tOfGtcUIW

Sweden's unusual approach to fighting #COVID19 has drawn interest around the world.  Bloomberg reporter @Hoikkis explains how Swedes are following social-distancing guidelines https://t.co/cjqAmwBHoK
#COVID19 relief around the world includes $2,000/month or 75% or more of workers' salaries.  In the U.S. Americans got a one time $1,200 check, while massive corporations get million dollar bailouts &amp; huge restaurant chains abuse "small" business relief.  We must do better.
