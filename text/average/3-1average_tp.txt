/3 Perspective:  Trump told us March 30 that he's doing a ‚Äúvery good job‚Äù because only 100,000 or fewer Americans might die from #coronavirus. So far, the death toll is 5.6x the combined total of:  -9/11  -D-Day -Pearl Harbor
As I write this, more than 45,100 Americans have succumbed to the #coronavirus. #China killed them. Why are we still doing business with that country?
Disqualified...not only then but now. -45 isn't qualified to do anything!

REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.
Donald Trump and Imran Khan had a phone call today-their first, I believe, in 2020. No surprises about the topics, based on this readout. Though I'm struck that PM Khan didn't bring up Kashmir at all (unless he did and it's not highlighted here, which would also be surprising).

45,153 deaths due to #COVID19   I vowed to RT this every day an American dies from #coronavirus .  There are uncounted causalities, becuz we still have a shortage of #TestingForCovid19   Trvmp &amp; the people below have blood on their hands!   #TrumpPlague #TrumpPandemic https://t.co/ORHQtcGN6f

Serious question for those of you that are in the ‚Äúwe need to expand testing‚Äù camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it‚Äôs safe to assume I‚Äôm not the only one.
