French researchers to test nicotine patches on coronavirus patients https://t.co/HS9vDUq6G7 My latest share from the Guardian makes for odd but interesting reading. #covid19 certainly proving to be challenging in more ways that we might have expected.
Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs‚Äîincluding #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.

Proud to be an amici on this brief. The #coronavirus pandemic should not be an excuse to restrict a woman's access to abortion services. The states' arguments in these cases are unjustified on public health and medical grounds. 1/
It is interesting to watch/read the press briefings about #Covid19 in UG and KEN whether by the @MOH_Kenya /@MinofHealthUG or by the two presidents. The tone in Kenya is surprisingly militaristic/accusatory and so the public response to the briefings is also more negative.

And it failed the test. It does more harm than good in the VA tests. And in hospitals abroad their findings were much the same. It's a good drug - just not to fight covid-19.

I was hospitalized due to #Covid_19. It was a struggle to breathe and I felt like I was slowly drowning. Luckily, the doctors decided to try Hydroxychloroquine and Azithromycin. Within a few hours, the gasping for air stopped and I began improving. I went home 3 days later!

Is China's decision to lockdown Wuhan "draconian" as some Western media has said?  Since there aren't any vaccines, the lockdown of a region might be the most efficient way to prevent #COVID_19 from spreading. #KeyPhrase

Shouldn‚Äôt all news organization be equally emphasizing RECOVERIES from #COVID19 in the same way they are gleefully announcing hourly death counts?

Key question for reporters to ask White House coronavirus task team:  How many ‚Äúsilent spreaders‚Äù are there in the 320,000,000+ who are untested?  Without knowing this answer, there‚Äôs no way to predict stress on healthcare systems (or project how many doctors/nurses will die).
Probably the most ignorant thing written on twitter this decade.   I noticed you conveniently omitted Sweden from that list, given their 1,765 dead and 11.52% didn't suit your narrative.  Rebuttal:
