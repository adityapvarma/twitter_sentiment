BREAKING: UK #coronavirus hospital deaths rise by 763 in past 24hrs, bringing total to  18,100.  * this does not include 1000s more old &amp; vulnerable people who've died with COVID-19 in care homes or community, because Govt can't be bothered to find out exactly how many that is.
After this crisis there can be no return to the systematic erosion of labour rights and the structural exploitation of the low-paid that has left so many hundreds of millions vulnerable to this crisis.
so what's the mystery mammal?

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs‚Äîincluding #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.
Totally agree on the importance of flu shots - my issue is that for many in healthcare, #COVID19 prep and response happened during flu season this year. Hospitals were already busy and while not as bad as 17/18, this year was already challenging efforts https://t.co/mSiiOVl7Di

#COVID19 is expected to crest in our region this week. Sadly, it will translate to more people testing positive. And more deaths. Until we have more testing to understand the depth of this virus in our community, we cannot weaken rules like our stay at home order in @SaintLouCo.

Before people jump into band wagon of calling serological tests, currently unregulated, as panacea, there needs to be validation to figure what type and conc of viral-antibody response is necessary to protect against #COVID19 exposure &amp; how long that protection may last.
I am not a doctor by any stretch of the imagination, but after analyzing the empirical data over the last two months I believe that the best way to stop the spread of #coronavirus is for every person to practice social-distancing from the mainstream media.   It‚Äôs the only way.

The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?
Good on Chris Whitty - he's just poured cold water on the hype from Oxfotd University that they may have a vaccine by Sept&amp;Oct He's just said unlikely to have a vaccine within a year  Oxford Uni just flew a kite for more funding! #PressBriefing #CoronaVirus #COVID19

"Everybody here has been vaccinated anyway" -- caught on tape.
I listened, but I still can't actually believe what I heard..!  The MINISTER FOR HEALTH says it's called "COVID-19" because there were 18 other coronaviruses before this one? And developing a vaccine will be difficult because they weren't successful with any of the previous 18?üôä
