No new Minnesota counties with confirmed #covid19 cases. At 78 of 87 presently.  Counties of note: Nobles (JBS) - 126 cases (+25) and first death Kandiyohi (Jennie-O) - 3 cases (flat) Hennepin - 1073 cases (+60) and now 113 deaths
Either way, the number of excess deaths right now is well above those explained by #COVID19 diagnoses or mentions on death certificates. If one attributes them, one way or another, to the pandemic, one gets a significantly higher death toll - as per @ChrisGiles_ model.

BREAKING: UK #coronavirus hospital deaths rise by 763 in past 24hrs, bringing total to  18,100.  * this does not include 1000s more old &amp; vulnerable people who've died with COVID-19 in care homes or community, because Govt can't be bothered to find out exactly how many that is.
By planning to hold meetings, appearances, and fundraisers, Trump is sending a dangerous message: Damn the #COVID19 warnings, full steam ahead. People will die because of his reckless irresponsibility.  https://t.co/LhgME7WyWV

Our organization has always advocated against over-incarceration.   But what #COVID19 uncovered is: our country‚Äôs obsession with locking people up in jails and prisons as a first response to everything is NOT a solution--it actually endangers us all.  THREAD
I think tracing is wasted effort.  It's smarter to put money toward research to determine 1.  What does having antibodies to #COVID19 do for you? 2. Testing to see who has antibodies. 3. Vaccine to boost anyibodies. 4. How this virus actually works.

Kudos to @Naveen_Odisha Ji for leading the fight against the #Coronavirus with a strong determination to protect the health and well-being of people. His administration and approach during the pandemic has been efficient and filled with compassion.
The fault lies with @INCIndia  You have failed as principal opposition party to counter the onslaught on secular fabric, institutions and freedom of speech in the country. U all look like helpless spectators.

Wow. Santa Clara County announces that autopsies find three people died from #COVID19 before March 9, originally thought to be first county death  One of those people died Feb. 6 long before
REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?

Serious question for those of you that are in the ‚Äúwe need to expand testing‚Äù camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it‚Äôs safe to assume I‚Äôm not the only one.
üò¨  I'm guessing that's adjusted to count more than just the hospital deaths for the North.

At Monday's @WhiteHouse press conference it was stated that 50,000-60,000 Americans will die from #coronavirus.  2 days later, there are 45,000+ #COVID19 deaths in the USA (and real number is higher because not all deceased are tested).
