It's the Persian Gulf not the American Gulf. The Trump regime badly miscalculated if it thinks Iran will be intimidated. Trump has not yet paid for the murder of General Soleimani or Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Hence, it would be best if he focused on the #COVID19 catastrophe at home.

When you hear the outbreak isn’t “as bad as we feared” or you see data supporting #COVID19 decline, it means staying home + social distancing is WORKING. I loathe it, but if we don’t continue, we do it all over again. #StayHome, distance, + be safe so we can beat this thing. 🖤

Ffs. The virus doesn't "target the elderly &amp; the vulnerable".  The elderly and vulnerable are more likely to get *complications* from #COVID19, particularly as they're more *likely* to already have underlying health issues.  #downingstreet #coronavirus #SelfIsolation #StayHome

The UN predicts famine &amp; mass starvation across the world as a result of the economic shutdown. The good news, from the media’s point of view, is that they can count the famine &amp; starvation deaths as #Coronavirus deaths, thus vindicating the hysteria that caused the cataclysm

@spikedonline @Dunphy_Official It’s actually quite sick that people would use the #COVID19 crisis as an opportunity to attack the government. Chief among the fifth columnists has been James O’Brien. It’s disgraceful.
By airing her views,  @DeutscheWelle (DW), the German public broadcaster, has virtually endorsed Arundati Roy's reckless charge that India is practising Genocide. We should not take this lying down. @DrSJaishankar  #AntiIndiaForeignMedia  My take:
It’s sure is. This is perfect for him. #wagthedog this is just one more piece of sh*t on the growing pile created when 1) he left the Paris Accord, 2) thru impeachment and on to a 3) pandemic failure he’s created in the long 3 1/2 yrs
#COVID19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets. This can happen by  1. Being in close contact with an infected person  2. Touching a contaminated surface  When we congregate in crowds, it puts us all at risk for contracting #COVID19  #StayAtHome #TakeResponsibility https://t.co/RISPgS7a2R
The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?

@DeanObeidallah @realDonaldTrump @nytimes Tens of thousands Americans are dying.  Trump tweets about his ratings for his #coronavirus briefings.  They aren’t his!  They are for the Coronavirus task force for the entire country.  He is a sociopathic narcissist.  Anyone who still supports him can go fuck themselves.
Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.
The failure of the #Indian health system to counter #coronavirus shouldn't be diverted to racist rhetoric towards Muslims Because the #pandemic does not differentiate between religions

The virus had obviously circulating for many weeks if not longer  out West...and soon we will see just how the viral stains attenuated. Fascinating.  We made big decisions based on faulty data, bad models.

Are we really depending on a Taoiseach who has no exit plan and a minister for Health who thinks there has been 18 other Covids before #COVID19 . Honestly people, do you really think they know they are doing?  Ps: The 19 stands for 2019 which is the year it was discovered.

Why do #COVID19 deaths matter more? Seems to me there’s dishonest sentimental narrative going on: ‘all deaths are equally tragic’. No they aren’t. Someone in their 80s with dementia dying of CV is far less tragic than a 50yr old dying due to not getting treatment for cancer et al

Prof. Giesecke, adviser to Tegnell, "Sweden's decision is that measures should be evidence-based."  Two mins later, "a substantial % of the pop. probably had #COVID19, I'm rather certain, but we don’t have tests yet.” How the fuck is that evidence-based if you haven't tested yet?

It's the Persian Gulf not the American Gulf. The Trump regime badly miscalculated if it thinks Iran will be intimidated. Trump has not yet paid for the murder of General Soleimani or Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Hence, it would be best if he focused on the #COVID19 catastrophe at home.

Two ways of looking at this:  1. We have a pandemic that’s piling pressure on the NHS &amp; to be indulging in this is in shockingly poor taste. 2. You haven’t got enough to do despite the Country being under Lockdown (for your benefit) so this is in shockingly poor taste.   Grow up.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.
"When asked why Ugandans are being given these drugs even as the cases are mild, Byakika said they give the medicines to guard against a likelihood of the disease progressing since patients elsewhere who have tested positive tend to progress quickly."  What bullshit.
I strongly support this huge show of solidarity with the EU's regional partners. Europe's success in tackling #COVID19 is deeply linked to the health of our friends and neighbours. #EUSolidarity
