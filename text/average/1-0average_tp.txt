Downplaying the pandemic by comparing a year's worth of deaths from the flu to a month's worth of deaths from #COVID19 is foolish.  It is the rate of increase in deaths from baseline that matters, and the spike in deaths from COVID19 is alarming.  #Cdnpoli https://t.co/W5DiWNA431

If the federal and provincial governments wanted to provide some relief and kickstart the post-#COVID19 economy, they would forgive all or part of post-secondary student loans, based on income. The 6-month pause on payment and interest is helpful, but kicks the can down the road.
The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?
How shameful these people are, the cops and doctors are doing for to save their life but even though they are attacking on them.

It has now been several months since #COVID19 first entered our consciousness. We still have much to learn about it. But, to my thinking, three key points have become clear. I will try to summarize them here.
Florida hosted spring break &amp; winter solstice during the #coronavirus pandemic.  Despite having a large elderly population &amp; never locking down their state‚Äîhospital bed space has INCREASED &amp; they maintain a very low death rate.   Time to #ReopenAmerica!  https://t.co/loEVnTGUhV

Adityanath govt to keep Tablighi Jamaat members who test positive in temporary jails.   While other countries are setting up hospitals to treat the #COVID19 victims, UP has set up 23 temporary jails for them based on religion!?  What kind of hate is this during a pandemic?
The @WHO is now saying that due to a potential second resurgence of #COVID19 in the winter, we should all get flu shots this year.  Does anyone follow that logic?  Does the flu shot somehow protect against COVID now?
@realDonaldTrump @CNN You're factually incorrect.  And making him put out a "corrected" statement to toe your asinine propaganda line isn't going to change that.  You're not relevant to the American conversation on #COVID19, Slick.  You had a chance, you blew it.     Deal with it.  #TrumpBodyCount

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs‚Äîincluding #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.
