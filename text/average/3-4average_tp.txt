The virus is a protein. It has one purpose: to replicate itself.  It needs a warm, moist spot - like your sinuses, eyes and mouth. It cannot survive soap and water but it can live for long periods of time in the air and on surfaces. Humans have no immunity. Stay home. Stay safe.

Downplaying the pandemic by comparing a year's worth of deaths from the flu to a month's worth of deaths from #COVID19 is foolish.  It is the rate of increase in deaths from baseline that matters, and the spike in deaths from COVID19 is alarming.  #Cdnpoli https://t.co/W5DiWNA431

No drug is ever "completely vetted."  Hydroxychloroquine did &amp; still does have promise with #COVID19.  In an emergency, you do the best you can.  Completely reasonable for Trump to mention it to hopefully save lives, &amp; completely unreasonable for media/left to want it to fail.

@BenjiisMad @AOC #Covid19 has already killed nearly 50,000 people in the US in a few weeks--which is the equivalent of a bad flu season, despite shutting the whole country down. If we'd let it spread unchecked, it would have killed many more than seasonal flu because it's more contagious.
This isn't about protecting jobs. It's about xenophobia.   President Trump's response to #COVID19 is a national disgrace, and now he's using the crisis to implement his anti-immigrant agenda. We should instead be focused on access to testing and treatment. https://t.co/Av5LgAn018

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs‚Äîincluding #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.

States are beginning to "open up" after several weeks of shelter to prevent the spread of #coronavirus . In some communities, there may be justification. In others resources are inadequate and #COVID19 remains a serious problem. In every place, #cancer pts need to be cautious.

Speaker Pelosi just blamed Mitch McConnell for delaying the latest #coronavirus relief package.   Seriously?   The Speaker literally congratulated Senate Democrats for blocking the bill last week!  https://t.co/55mqa4smdI
NEW: The #coronavirus appears to be causing sudden strokes in adults in their 30s + 40s who are not otherwise terribly ill, doctors report.  There‚Äôs growing evidence that #Covid19 infection can cause blood to clot unnaturally, and stroke would be an expected consequence of that.
WOW. Andrea Mitchell just asked Savannah, Georgia Mayor  Johnson if he has spoken with Governor Kemp since he made this announcement in the last 24 hours to re-open Georgia.  His response: We have NOT heard from the Governor or his staff SINCE #COVID19 has BEGUN! https://t.co/NAqg62YIAk

It's the Persian Gulf not the American Gulf. The Trump regime badly miscalculated if it thinks Iran will be intimidated. Trump has not yet paid for the murder of General Soleimani or Abu Mahdi al-Muhandis. Hence, it would be best if he focused on the #COVID19 catastrophe at home.
