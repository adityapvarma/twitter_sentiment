This is a must see! PBS @NewsHour did a segment on 🇺🇬 &amp; “How Uganda's history of epidemics has prepared it for COVID-19”. Congrats, to #Uganda for being a global example of how to prevent, detect, &amp; respond to an infectious disease outbreak like #COVID19! https://t.co/xO9q1jazhh
This is such an awesome gesture. Garissa County Governor @HonAliKorane announces that his government will support 6000 needy families during the month of Ramadhan to cushion them during this corona virus pandemic.

Stay home this Ramadan. Prophet Muhammad (PBUH) encouraged self-isolation during plague "If you hear of an outbreak of plague in a land, do not enter it; but if the plague outbreaks out in a place while you are in it, do not leave that place." #Covid_19 guidance translated pls RT https://t.co/X6E3Loy78G

Today is Wed. That means @realDonaldTrump is lying, again. @CDCDirector already promoted on Twitter an article about his quote that 2nd #COVID19 wave could be worse because it coincides with flu.  It would be another dereliction of duty for Trump to not plan for that possibility.

I agree with Chairman Engel – protecting public health and basic human rights go hand-in-hand. President Bukele should comply with court ruling &amp; work with congress to meet people’s needs &amp; food security during quarantine. El Salvador needs democracy, not authoritarian rule.
This is an incredible program, especially when combined with the  Canada Summer Jobs program and the new Canada Student Service Grant. Kudos to the Trudeau Government.   #cdnpoli #covidcanada #COVID19

How can a vaccine be created when the #COVID19 virus gets stronger (&amp; sometimes weaker) as it passes thru hosts (humans)? It is not the same virus as it was just 6 weeks ago &amp; different than it was 12 weeks ago. Get smart &amp; stay well. Stay locked down or plan your burial.

Downplaying the pandemic by comparing a year's worth of deaths from the flu to a month's worth of deaths from #COVID19 is foolish.  It is the rate of increase in deaths from baseline that matters, and the spike in deaths from COVID19 is alarming.  #Cdnpoli https://t.co/W5DiWNA431

Yes it’s in this week’s @PrivateEyeNews. A lot of spread initially was from young fit people returning from skiing holiday. Very few likely to die.

@HeidiNBC The headline by Detroit News is misleading: it reads as if she had a pre-existing “rare complication” b4 she got sick that made her more likely to die. In fact, she was healthy &amp; developed the “rare complication” *because* of #COVID19. Bottom line: healthy children can die.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

@BenjiisMad @AOC #Covid19 has already killed nearly 50,000 people in the US in a few weeks--which is the equivalent of a bad flu season, despite shutting the whole country down. If we'd let it spread unchecked, it would have killed many more than seasonal flu because it's more contagious.
This isn't about protecting jobs. It's about xenophobia.   President Trump's response to #COVID19 is a national disgrace, and now he's using the crisis to implement his anti-immigrant agenda. We should instead be focused on access to testing and treatment. https://t.co/Av5LgAn018

Yes. Incredible. If you spend an hour with someone who has #Coronavirus, in a small room with recycled air, you have 2/3 chance of being absolutely fine.  And of the 9 that caught it, 6-8 never even new they had it.  People are repeating numbers a lot, but not understanding them.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

States are beginning to "open up" after several weeks of shelter to prevent the spread of #coronavirus . In some communities, there may be justification. In others resources are inadequate and #COVID19 remains a serious problem. In every place, #cancer pts need to be cautious.
We must reopen our economy by following the facts and science, which means we must first drastically increase testing and contact tracing to reduce the spread of #COVID19. I am championing the Reopen American Act to protect public health while we reopen the economy.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

This has been my approach. I was already familiar with the basics of epidemiologic models, but not nearly enough to add signal by modeling or graphing myself.  But I can spot naive errors and communicate the basics—hopefully clearly and without introducing more noise.

Premature re-opening leads to new deaths. People are dying every 32 seconds in America from #coronavirus. Trump is not talking about reality. If you are harboring the darkest of fantasies these days, I believe that’s a healthy response. The daily tv show is so wrong, so painful.

@mgafni @MaMoMVPY The state of Washington had their first positive #COVID19 test on January 21st.   So it isn't really that remarkable that a death would have occurred on February 6th since there is so much travel between the USA (especially the west coast) and China.
The public should be informed which 5 LTC homes now require military intervention and the status of those facilities.

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs—including #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.
