@realDonaldTrump @CNN I really don't care if you're literally spending all day wasting time on twitter. I mean, it's not like we simultaneously have the worst #pandemic and financial crisis in 100 years, right? #Trump #COVID19 #Coronavirus
Nurses protested in front of the White House today for PPE. They read the names of healthcare workers who died while treating those with #COVID19. 💔 https://t.co/FK3fl6Me4v
We believe strongly that our #socialdistancing has made a big impact because we started early. As we start to open up again, we're committed to monitoring cases and open up in a slow fashion that will be safest for our patients, staff, and community.
We sit at home complaining bout the rise in cases. Imagine how the workers will be feeling everyday, hoping they're not infected. Imagine how the healthcare workers will be feeling with the nonstop influx of patients. GOD please have mercy.
I wish this had been the narrative from Day 1 on all of this.  Open all the businesses up and just go out far less.

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs—including #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.

Yes it’s in this week’s @PrivateEyeNews. A lot of spread initially was from young fit people returning from skiing holiday. Very few likely to die. Going in hard &amp; fast on contact tracing prevented them becoming super spreaders to the elderly. It’s what we should’ve done. https://t.co/gMhhx1WrZX

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs—including #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.
In order to beat #COVID-19 and ease restrictions, testing is paramount. Provinces and territories need more testing kits. When will the Trudeau Liberals fast-track the approval process and clear the backlog?

BREAKING: UK #coronavirus hospital deaths rise by 763 in past 24hrs, bringing total to  18,100.  * this does not include 1000s more old &amp; vulnerable people who've died with COVID-19 in care homes or community, because Govt can't be bothered to find out exactly how many that is.
@CollegeLoreto are looking for your pictures!! Please share and let’s stick together although we must stay apart
@JordanSchachtel   Confused re: #covid-19 policy  Birx policy of rolling regional re-openings based on lowering new cases #’s seems supported by Murphy model. Predicted by Aug.:  16K deaths in NY 60 K deaths in US   Well on our way to that, &amp; it’s only April! https://t.co/jW7QsuUK6n

This is important. Until now the first US #COVID19 death was thought to be Feb 29th, Seattle WA https://t.co/ziFslDHShl But now autopsy (and @CDCgov) confirmation of 2 deaths in California Feb 6 and 17th.  &gt;3 weeks earlier than previously known. https://t.co/9hRGJp0QZg
A cousin told today that his best friend's father, mother &amp; brother are hospitalized due to #COVID19 in Pakistan.  Father got it from Mosque when he refused to listen &amp; stop going there for prayers. He then gave to others.  I was devastated to hear.  Praying for them to recover !
REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

And the two things that slowed down testing? Narrow limits on who could be tested, plus the US refusal to use the @WHO recommended test, instead instructed the CDC to build its own, which was faulty. USA lost about a month due to (let's say it) politics and racism.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.

Justice demands they pay their debt to society- his “mercy” was for criminals, not law abiding citizens. They were in jail because they fracture every law they disagree with. His refusal to apply justice resulted in more crime against citizens. But vote him in again.

As @Cernovich has confirmed, many "journalists" are scanning the social media feeds of recently deceased #COVID19 victims to find any evidence of posts downplaying the virus, etc. This isn't journalism or remotely decent behavior...
@piersmorgan So what if we are reporting comparable figures, it’s not a competition. Our government should be telling us the death toll, hospitals, care homes, people dying at home. It will most certainly be over the guesstimated 20,000. I am with You in this Piers.#coronavirus

BREAKING: UK #coronavirus hospital deaths rise by 763 in past 24hrs, bringing total to  18,100.  * this does not include 1000s more old &amp; vulnerable people who've died with COVID-19 in care homes or community, because Govt can't be bothered to find out exactly how many that is.
1/ Okay, this is a big deal. Given the time lag from infection to symptoms to death, it implies that #SARSCoV2 was present in California by mid-January at the latest - but it is very unlikely that the first person to develop #COVID in the US died from it.  https://t.co/Cpgy1pFdO1

Very interesting. 1st official US covid death in Santa Clara early Feb, which means late Jan likely infected. With antibody tests coming out, very curious to see whether more were infected than not, which would greatly impact shelter-in-place / economy

@GregAbbott_TX carefully orchestrated this downward trajectory by ensuring that a bare minimal number of Texans get tested.  He may more thoughtfully choose his words but his actions, when it comes to health outcomes in Texas, are no better than Trump’s.

#COVID19 is primarily spread through respiratory droplets. This can happen by  1. Being in close contact with an infected person  2. Touching a contaminated surface  When we congregate in crowds, it puts us all at risk for contracting #COVID19  #StayAtHome #TakeResponsibility https://t.co/RISPgS7a2R
Samples of those early cases were sent to the CDC and results came back today that they were indeed the first US cases (that we know of)  And it again raises the question of whether or not there are many more at-home #COVID19 deaths not part of the death toll tabulation

In north east #China’s #Harbin, reports that one hospital has temporarily closed and another partly closed because a patient - who’s now tested positive for the #coronavirus - visited them, infecting others, sparking a cluster of 78 #covid19 cases at these facilities.
Premature re-opening leads to new deaths. People are dying every 32 seconds in America from #coronavirus. Trump is not talking about reality. If you are harboring the darkest of fantasies these days, I believe that’s a healthy response. The daily tv show is so wrong, so painful.

@JohnCornyn Purpose of this tweet: If you’re not 100% with no underlying health conditions, you deserve to die.

Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs—including #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.

Serious question for those of you that are in the “we need to expand testing” camp.   Do you expect testing to be compulsory?   Because I have no plans to get tested for #coronavirus, and in a nation of 330 million people, it’s safe to assume I’m not the only one.
Here are the facts:  1) President Trump has the authority to use the DPA to meet a number of critical needs—including #COVID19 tests.  2) Congress allocated $1B to the DPA fund for that exact reason.  3) 40,000 Americans died before President Trump used the DPA to order tests.

Premature re-opening leads to new deaths. People are dying every 32 seconds in America from #coronavirus. Trump is not talking about reality. If you are harboring the darkest of fantasies these days, I believe that’s a healthy response. The daily tv show is so wrong, so painful.
Black people have died for capitalism for 400 yrs. From plantations, to cotton fields, factories, coal mines, and every form of low wage grunt work, we’ve worked into early graves to make wypipo money.  The hell with dying of #COVID19 for inhumane, greedy, rich, racist bastards.
Per @SpeakerPelosi @LeaderHoyer they’re going to conduct their business virtually. Lawmakers are just as human as you and me and they can’t risk getting sick during this pandemic.

Kudos to @Naveen_Odisha Ji for leading the fight against the #Coronavirus with a strong determination to protect the health and well-being of people. His administration and approach during the pandemic has been efficient and filled with compassion.
Wearing a cloth face covering CORRECTLY can help prevent the spread of #COVID19 to others. When you go out on essential trips, follow these “do’s”. If you have a child, remember those under age 2 should not wear a face covering. See  https://t.co/O0ex0K3PD1 https://t.co/LMQIr9sE1z

Never get the flu shot and never will.
Flu shots might keep you from a double whammy, Covid 19 on top of the flu. But researchers have to anticipate what flu syrain might be coming and make the right vaccine. Getting healthy and working on your immune system is a better plan in my opinion
