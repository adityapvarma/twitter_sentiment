REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

Workers have given up 100 % of their incomes, risked lives, and made countless sacrifices in the face of #COVID19.  Our #TaxAmazon legislation calls on big business to give up a measly 1 % (actually &lt; 1%), yet they're crying foul.  Speak out this morning!  https://t.co/BB9QIgtnPD
1/ Because so many have re-sent this to me, here's my take.   This was a garbage "study" and we learn nothing from it. 1- not randomized.  MD's selected patients based on severity 2 - HCQ *late* in disease vs early when antivirals provide most benefit 3 - No zinc

BREAKING: UK #coronavirus hospital deaths rise by 763 in past 24hrs, bringing total to  18,100.  * this does not include 1000s more old &amp; vulnerable people who've died with COVID-19 in care homes or community, because Govt can't be bothered to find out exactly how many that is.
It's because security personnel are unable to differentiate between those going to the the hospital for real and those using it as an excuse to beat the lock down curfew, they turn everyone back. My baby's six months vitamin A immunization was last Friday and we were turned back.
@Beatthemedian has been advised by a leading cancer specialist that people with cancer do not undergo chemo.... during #Covid19.   More deaths from cancer!

BREAKING: UK #coronavirus hospital deaths rise by 763 in past 24hrs, bringing total to  18,100.  * this does not include 1000s more old &amp; vulnerable people who've died with COVID-19 in care homes or community, because Govt can't be bothered to find out exactly how many that is.
REMINDER: Health Secretary @MattHancock didn't promise there would be 'capacity' for 100,000 #coronavirus tests a day by end of April - he promised 100,000 people a day would be tested. Big difference.  This week fewer people (18k a day) have been tested than 12 days ago.

We must reopen our economy by following the facts and science, which means we must first drastically increase testing and contact tracing to reduce the spread of #COVID19. I am championing the Reopen American Act to protect public health while we reopen the economy.
